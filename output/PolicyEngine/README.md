## **General Description**

The Policy Engine provides a suite of functionality to inspect, process and use ODRL policies.

## **Main Goal/Functionalities**

Currently the following main functionalities are supported: 

* Visualising an ODRL policy to inspect it
* Validating the correctness of an ODRL policy file against the specification
* Evaluating one or more ODRL policies against a State of the World (like an event log, or a data access request)
* Generating synthetic ODRL policies, and generating synthetic States of the World about policies to be used for testing purposes.

## **How To Install**

### Requirements

Python, rdflib, pyshacl, pandas

### Detailed Steps

Currently the Policy Engine can be inported as a Python library to use its main functions. The code for the core functions of the Policy Engine can be found in the `PolicyEngineLibrary` subfolder.



## Expected KPIs

| What | How | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1) Policy management expressiveness: ability to represent data processing regulations in a machine processable form. 2) Policy-based Data Access Control Accuracy | 1) analysis of an existing large (>100) corpus of data sharing/data processing agreements 2) Experiments over at least two policies, asking the pilots to express (in machine processable form, through our tool's interface) a sample (min 20 each) of( access requests (evenly distributed as requests to be permitted, and to be denied).  | 1) Ability to move >15% of contractual clauses and privacy policies in an average agreement to machine-processable form. 2) High accuracy (>90%) in predicting the correct access control response  |
