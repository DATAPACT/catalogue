## Expected KPIs
This KPI is shared with the Policy Service suite of tools, which include the Policy Editor, the Policy Enginge and the Ontology Service, as it is affected by the expressiveness of the ODRL Policy language used.

| What | How | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Policy management expressiveness: ability to represent data processing regulations in a machine processable form. | analysis of an existing large (>100) corpus of data sharing/data processing agreements  | analysis of an existing large (>100) corpus of data sharing/data processing agreements| Ability to move >15% of contractual clauses and privacy policies in an average agreement to machine-processable form.  |
